The other day, I wanted to separate work & personal accounts on my fedora. But switching between the sessions won't be easy. So, I went to the internet. But here is the twist, I didn't find any help for this. And hence, I ended up with a perfect solution for my case.
* Create two separate user accounts
* Log-in ordinarily to one of them
* Press Ctrl+Alt+F1
* Log-in to your second account
* Press Ctrl+Alt+F2
Now, you can switch between the accounts by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F2 and Ctrl+Alt+F4.
